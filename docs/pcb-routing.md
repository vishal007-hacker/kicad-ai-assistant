# PCB Routing Guide

The KiCad MCP server provides a **no-shove PNS router** that connects
two pads with an obstacle-avoiding track.  It is exposed through the
`pcb_route_pad_to_pad` MCP tool.

## Single-layer routing

```python
await pcb_route_pad_to_pad(
    pcb_path="/path/to/board.kicad_pcb",
    ref_a="R1", pad_a="2",
    ref_b="C1", pad_b="2",
    net="VCC",
    layer="F.Cu",        # optional, default "F.Cu"
    width=0.5,           # optional; uses netclass track width if omitted
)
```

The router walks the pad-exit points of `R1.2` and `C1.2` and A*'s a
visibility graph over the obstacle-free regions.  The track is added
to the board on the same layer as the source pad.  Obstacles include:

* Same-net tracks are *not* obstacles (you are extending them).
* Footprint courtyards for components other than the two endpoints.
* Existing tracks of *other* nets.
* Keepout zones on the active layer.

Only copper on the requested routing layer blocks a single-layer route;
copper on other layers is a parallel plane and is ignored.  The board
bounds check exempts the two endpoint pads' rectangles: a pad whose
copper straddles the board edge (edge-mounted connectors) is a legal
terminus, even though the track must otherwise stay inside the
Edge.Cuts outline.  The outline includes Edge.Cuts profiles drawn
*inside* footprints — an edge-mounted connector (e.g. a card bay)
describes the notch it sits in with its own Edge.Cuts items, and that
region is real board area, so tracks may run into it.

## Multi-layer routing (via insertion)

If the source and destination pads are on different copper layers (e.g.
an SMD pad on F.Cu and an SMD pad on In1.Cu), the router inserts vias to
reach the destination.  Specify the via layer pairs the router is
allowed to use:

```python
await pcb_route_pad_to_pad(
    pcb_path="/path/to/board.kicad_pcb",
    ref_a="R1", pad_a="2",
    ref_b="U1", pad_b="5",
    net="VCC",
    via_pairs=(("F.Cu", "B.Cu"), ("B.Cu", "In1.Cu")),
)
```

Layer selection is automatic: SMD/connect pads use their fixed layer;
thru-hole pads (`*.Cu`) pick a shared copper layer, preferring
`layer_hint` when it is valid.  When both pads are thru-hole and share
a layer, the route stays on a single layer (no vias).

### Response shape

The tool returns a dict with these keys (in addition to the keys for
the single-layer case):

| Key | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `via_count` | `int` | Number of vias written to the board. |
| `vias` | `list[dict]` | Each dict has `x`, `y`, `diameter`, `drill`, `layers` (`[from, to]`), and `net`. |
| `layers_used` | `list[str]` | Ordered, deduplicated list of layers the path traversed. |

### Via cost

The default via cost is `2.0 + 0.5 * n` millimetres, where `n` is the
number of vias the route has already taken.  A two-via path costs
`2.0 + 2.5 = 4.5 mm` of via overhead.  This biases the router toward
fewer-layer solutions when both are viable.

### Adding vias

Use ``pcb_add_vias`` to drop one or more through-hole vias.  Pass a
single-element list for a one-off via, or many for ground-plane
stitching / fan-out.  All vias are written in a single PCB rewrite
with one ``.bak`` covering the whole batch.

```python
# Single via
await pcb_add_vias(
    pcb_path="/path/to/board.kicad_pcb",
    vias=[{"x": 40.0, "y": 25.0, "net": "GND"}],
)

# Many vias (ground stitching / fan-out)
await pcb_add_vias(
    pcb_path="/path/to/board.kicad_pcb",
    vias=[
        {"x": 30.0, "y": 35.0, "net": "VCC"},
        {"x": 40.0, "y": 35.0, "net": "GND", "diameter": 1.0, "drill": 0.5},
        {"x": 50.0, "y": 35.0, "net": "GND", "layers": ("F.Cu", "In1.Cu")},
    ],
)
```

Each descriptor accepts optional ``diameter`` (default 0.8), ``drill``
(default 0.4), ``layers`` (default ``("F.Cu", "B.Cu")``); only
``x``, ``y`` and ``net`` are required.  An empty list is a no-op (no
write, no backup).  An invalid descriptor (missing ``net``,
non-numeric coordinate, etc.) rejects the *whole* batch and leaves
the file untouched.

#### Pre-flight checks

Before any write, every via is checked against:

* the matching ``.kicad_pro`` — the via's ``net`` must resolve to a
  netclass (or fall back to ``Default``), and the requested
  ``diameter`` / ``drill`` must not exceed that class.  Missing
  ``.kicad_pro`` is a hard error: there is no silent skip.
* the project-level DRC rules in ``board.design_settings.rules`` —
  ``min_via_size`` and ``min_through_drill`` are lower bounds on the
  via dimensions; ``min_via_annular_width`` is the lower bound on
  ``(diameter - drill) / 2``; ``min_clearance`` is the minimum
  copper-to-copper distance (the via pad ring is buffered by this
  before the collision check); ``hole_to_hole_min`` is the minimum
  centre-to-centre distance between this via's hole and every
  existing via's hole (and every other via in the same batch);
  ``copper_edge_clearance`` keeps the via's centre inside the board
  outline.
* the board geometry — the via's pad ring must not overlap any
  footprint courtyard, other-net track/via, or zone keepout, and
  must stay inside the board outline with the configured
  ``copper_edge_clearance``.

Any violation rejects the whole batch and leaves the file
untouched.  The error response includes a `violations` array with
`index` (the position in the input list), `kind`, and `message`
fields per violation, plus a single concatenated `error` string
for the human-readable summary.

## Failure modes

| Failure | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `RouteFailure: Pad <ref>/<pad> not found` | No pad with that name exists on the footprint.  A pad that exists but has no copper on the requested layer fails with the layer-naming error below instead. |
| `RouteFailure: Pad <ref>/<pad> has no copper shape on layer '<layer>'` | The pad exists, but no same-named pad has a copper shape on the requested layer. |
| `RouteFailure: No obstacle-avoiding path from <a> to <b> across layers [...]` | No combination of exit points / via transitions yields a clear path.  Check obstacles and via pairs. |
| `RouteFailure: Via at (x, y) would extend outside the board` | At least one via pad does not fit inside the Edge.Cuts board outline.  Move the route or shrink the board. |

The tool returns `{"error": "..."}` on any of the above; the board
file is **not** modified on failure.

A footprint may declare several pads with the same name — edge-connector
fingers sharing a net, e.g. a micro:bit edge connector exposing several
`3v3` pads (SMD fingers plus one thru-hole pad).  The router resolves
the pad by the requested layer: routing to `U11/3v3` on `B.Cu` targets
the same-named pad whose copper is actually on `B.Cu` (typically the
thru-hole pad), not merely the first occurrence in the footprint.  A
thru-hole pad's center is a valid track terminus — the plated barrel
carries the connection.

### Same-net pad copper and drill holes

The world model drops same-net pad copper entirely (the route must be
able to land on its own endpoint pads).  The router re-adds every
same-net pad as a transit obstacle on the copper layers it covers so
the track never overlaps other same-net pad copper — it terminates on
the endpoint pad only and connects to other same-net pads by separate
tracks later.  Buffer is ``width/2 + clearance``: the track edge must
keep a full clearance gap from the pad copper, same as for any other
obstacle.  If this makes the route impossible at the requested width,
that is the correct answer — try a narrower track.  The two endpoint
pads are exempt on their own terminal layers so the track can
start/end at their centres; a same-net thru-hole pad's drill hole is
covered by its pad-copper obstacle (non-endpoint pads), so a track
never crosses a hole the drill physically severs.

Vias must never land on any same-net pad face (a DFM defect: solder
wicking, annular-ring breakout).  Via-forbidden zones cover **every**
same-net pad, not just the two endpoint pads — a multi-layer route's
vias are kept off all same-net fingers and annuli.
