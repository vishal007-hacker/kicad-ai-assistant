        PCB coordinates are mm with +X right, **+Y down**, and rotation
        is in degrees, **CCW-positive on screen** (KiCad PCB convention —
        the same CCW convention as the .kicad_sym library data; 0=right,
        90=up). This tool does NOT auto-snap; pass coordinates
        already aligned to your board grid (typical SMD work uses
        0.1 mm or 0.05 mm; through-hole often 1.27 mm / 50 mil).

        Any of x, y, rotation may be omitted (None) to leave that value
        unchanged.  At least one of them must be provided.

        By default (``force=False``) the tool automatically adjusts the
        position when the requested coordinates would cause a courtyard
        overlap: it scans outward on a 1.27 mm grid (up to 20 mm radius)
        and places the footprint at the nearest collision-free spot.
        If no free spot is found within 20 mm, the footprint is **not**
        moved and an error is returned.
        **Do NOT set ``force=True`` as a routine workaround.** Only use
        it when overlap is genuinely intentional and unavoidable (e.g.
        edge connectors flush with the board edge, press-fit connectors,
        or fiducials deliberately placed near other features).

        A .kicad_pcb.bak backup is created before writing.

            x: New X coordinate in mm (world), or None to keep current.
            y: New Y coordinate in mm (world), or None to keep current.
            rotation: New rotation in degrees, CCW-positive on screen
                (any value; KiCad normalises). None to keep current.
            force: Override the courtyard collision guard.  **Default
                False — only set True when overlap is genuinely
                intentional** (e.g. edge connectors, fiducials).  A
                warning is added to the result when overlaps are
