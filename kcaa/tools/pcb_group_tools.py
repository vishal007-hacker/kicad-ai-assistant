"""
PCB component group management and batch placement tools.

Groups are stored as a ``placement_group`` property on each footprint,
so group assignments persist in the .kicad_pcb file and are visible in
the KiCad GUI's footprint properties dialog.

Workflow:
  1. ``assign_footprints_to_group`` — tag footprints with a group name (batch).
  2. ``list_footprint_groups``      — inspect all groups on the board.
  3. ``get_footprint_group``        — details for one group (members, bbox, anchor).
  4. ``score_footprint_group``      — intra-group HPWL quality metric.
  5. ``place_footprint_group``      — two-phase automatic placement: arranges
                                      members radially (Phase 1) then finds the
                                      first clear board position via raster scan
                                      (Phase 2) and commits.
  6. ``move_footprint_group``       — translate a placed group as a rigid unit.
  7. ``rotate_footprint_group``     — rotate a placed group around its anchor.

PCB coordinate convention: mm, +X right, +Y down; file rotation is
CCW-positive on screen (KiCad convention: 0=right, 90=up).

    """Compute anchor-relative placement offsets using closest-first grid search.

    Algorithm
    ---------
    1. Pre-generate all KiCad-grid positions within *grid_radius_mm* of the
       anchor, sorted by Euclidean distance (closest first).
    2. For each member (connected-to-anchor members placed first, then
       unconnected), try candidate positions from closest outward.  At each
       position, choose the rotation that orients the component's long axis
       perpendicular to the nearest anchor edge (see ``_choose_rotation_for_grid``).
    3. Accept the first position where the component's courtyard (inflated by
       *gap_mm*) does not overlap the anchor courtyard or any already-placed
       member's courtyard.
    4. No cascade is required — only free slots are ever claimed.

        gap_mm: Minimum courtyard-to-courtyard gap in mm (default 1 mm).

    Returns:

        grid-snapped anchor-relative offsets.  A ``"warning"`` key is
        added when no clear position was found within the search radius.
