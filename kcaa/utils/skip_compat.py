"""Compatibility helpers for the skip library on Windows.

The skip library opens KiCad files without specifying an encoding parameter,
so Python falls back to the system default locale encoding.  On Windows the
default is typically ``gbk`` (CP936), which fails to decode KiCad's UTF-8
S-expression files.

This module provides a context manager that temporarily monkey-patches
``builtins.open`` so that text-mode opens without an explicit *encoding*
argument default to ``"utf-8"``.  The patch is deliberately limited:

* It only supplies ``encoding="utf-8"`` when the caller did NOT already pass
  an encoding — existing explicit encoding overrides are preserved.
* It does NOT touch ``sys.getfilesystemencoding()``, ``PYTHONUTF8``, or
  environment variables, so filesystem path handling remains unaffected.
* It restores the original ``builtins.open`` on exit, even if an exception
  occurs.

Usage::

    from kcaa.utils.skip_compat import safe_source_file, safe_schematic

    # Replace  skip.sexp.sourcefile.SourceFile(path)
    table = safe_source_file(path)

    # Replace  skip.Schematic(path)
    sch = safe_schematic(path)
