"""
High-level router orchestration: turn a user request into a list of
``OutputSegment`` + ``OutputVia`` ready to be written into a .kicad_pcb.

Pipeline
--------

1. **Load PCB & DRC**: parse the S-expression, read the matching ``.kicad_pro``
   for net class rules.
2. **Build world model**: hand the PCB to :func:`kcaa.router.world_model.
   build_world_model` so we know where all obstacles sit.
3. **Find pad centers**: locate the two pads to connect and read their copper
   pad shape's center.
4. **Pick exit points**: choose one or two candidate exit points on the pad
   edge for each end (axis-aligned first, 45 deg  if needed).
5. **Grid search + A\\***: build a walkability grid from inflated obstacles
   and run 8-direction A*.  Multi-layer routes insert via edges at legal
   (x, y) positions between layers in ``via_pairs``.
6. **Postprocess**: simplify collinear runs, miter corners, emit segments
   and vias at layer transitions.

Multi-layer routing
-------------------

When ``start_layer != end_layer`` the router builds one GridMap per
routing layer and runs a multi-layer A* that can insert via edges.
Via edges cost 2.0 mm (configurable) -- this penalises vias so A* prefers
routing on a single layer when possible.

No shove
--------

This is the **no-shove** variant. If a route is blocked, we raise
:class:`RouteFailure` rather than displacing existing tracks. That is enough
for ~80% of "connect A to B" requests; the remaining cases need the user to
move a track or add a via first.

class RouteRequest:
    """A request to connect two pads with a track.

    The pads may live on different copper layers; in that case the router
    will insert one or more vias to switch layers.

    Layer selection is automatic: the router inspects each pad's type and
    copper layers.  For SMD/connect pads the layer is fixed by the pad
    itself.  For thru-hole pads (``*.Cu``) the router picks the best
    shared copper layer, preferring ``layer_hint`` when it is valid.

    Attributes:
        pcb_path: Absolute path to the ``.kicad_pcb`` file.
        ref_a / pad_a: Reference designator and pad number for one end.
        ref_b / pad_b: Reference designator and pad number for the other end.
        net: Net name shared by both pads.
        layer_hint: Preferred copper layer for thru-hole pads.  When
            ``None`` (default) the router picks the best layer
            automatically.  Ignored for SMD pads whose layer is fixed.
        via_pairs: Allowed (top, bottom) layer pairs that may carry a
            through-via. Default is ``(("F.Cu", "B.Cu"),)``. Pass an
            explicit tuple to restrict transitions (e.g. to forbid inner-
            layer vias on a 4-layer board).
        width: Track width; ``None`` -> resolve from netclass.
        clearance: Minimum clearance to obstacles; ``None`` -> resolve from
            the board's design rules.
        via_diameter / via_drill: Through-via dimensions; ``None`` ->
            resolve from netclass.
        max_miter_mm: Maximum corner miter extension before falling back
            to a sharp 90 deg  corner.
        grid_resolution: Grid cell size in mm for the walkability grid.
            Smaller values give finer paths but more cells.  ``None``
            uses the default (0.025 mm).
        via_cost: Distance-equivalent penalty for taking a via edge in
            multi-layer A*.  Higher values discourage unnecessary stack
            vias.  Default 2.0 mm.
        turn_penalty: Distance-equivalent cost added when the path
            changes direction.  0 disables (pure shortest path).
            Default 0.3 mm ~ 3 cells at 0.1 mm resolution.
